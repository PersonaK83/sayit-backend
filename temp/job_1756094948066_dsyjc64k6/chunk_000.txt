Good day last and up three bears.
Chapter one, nope, nope, nope.
Three bears live in the warehouse of the rest of the world,
but all the neighbors were scared of the bears.
The one ever went to their house.
One day, a friend of the guard called Gold last,
decided to visit the three bears house.
Maybe she could make friends with them.
Now, now, now, for the last knock on the door,
hello, she called for no one and third.
Now, now, now, she knock for this time,
the door just opened little.
Good day last friends, inside, but the bears were not cold.
Chapter two, that's right.
Good day last lived around the room.
The room was very clean and tidy.
There was three turns by around the table.
One was big, one was small, and one was tiny.
I will sit and wait for the bear family to come home.
First, she said in the picture,
it is too big, she said.
Then, she said in the tiny chair.
That is broke, finally she said in the small chair.
Ah, this chair is those right, she said.
Chapter three, burp.
I wonder how the poor is the taste.
She said, all the losses of this room
and taste the poor is from the big bowl.
Oh, result is she said.
She did the tiny spoon and taste the poor.
