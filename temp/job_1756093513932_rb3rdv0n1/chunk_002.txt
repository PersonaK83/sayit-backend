for the last jump of the parent and spring.
Ah.
The three bears were also surprised.
They jumped back and spring.
Ah.
Only last one.
Very embarrassed.
I'm sorry.
I broke your chair.
I promised you a new one.
She said, I'm sorry.
I asked you for it.
It was the best forever.
She said, I'm sorry.
I sleep in your bed.
It was the most comfortable bed ever.
She said, the three bears left.
Don't worry that Papa Bear is okay.
It's okay, Papa Bear.
No, no, no, no.
It's a baby bear really.
It's a baby bear.
And the three bears were not angry anymore.
For the last, that she was sorry.
The bears were happy to share.
For the last one, back and to everyone around the three bears.
Soon everyone was friends with their new neighbors.
Good luck.
The three bears, the three gentle bears.
Good luck.
